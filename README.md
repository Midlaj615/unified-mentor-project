## Findings:
1**Attrition Rate Analysis**: This is the overall percentage of employees who have left Green Destinations during the study period.

2**Age and Attrition:**

The analysis shows that certain age groups have higher attrition rates.
Younger employees might be leaving for better opportunities, while older employees might be leaving due to retirement or other reasons.

3**Tenure Impact:**

Employees with shorter tenures (e.g., less than 2 years) show higher attrition rates.
This suggests that newer employees might not be as committed or could be finding better opportunities elsewhere.

4**Income Factor:**

Employees with lower income levels tend to have higher attrition rates.
This may indicate that salary and compensation are significant factors influencing employee turnover.
